<h2>Practice Sites</h2>

  <li><a href="https://hackthebox.eu">Hack The Box</a></li>
  Hack The Box is a great site for people who already have a working knowledge
  of penetration testing. It provides lots of boxes of varying difficulty with
  no hand-holding. While a box is active posting walkthroughs are against the
  terms of service and can get you banned so you are on your own outside of
  hints on the forums.
  <li><a href="https://tryhackme.com">Try Hack Me</a></li>
  This is a newer site but has started to gain popularity quite quickly. It is a
  little more beginner focused than Hack The Box is but that doesn't mean that
  there isn't a lot of difficult challenges here because there is.
  <li><a href="http://vulnhub.com">VulnHub</a></li>
  VulnHub allows you to download intentionally vulnerable virtual machines that
  you can test your skills against. Again machines here can vary across the
  difficulty spectrum.
